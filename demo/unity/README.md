# Picovoice Unity Demo

> Unity SDKs will no longer be maintained after **December 15, 2025**. If you plan to use the Picovoice Unity SDK for commercial purposes, please [contact us](https://picovoice.ai/contact/).

The Picovoice demo for Unity is a multi-platform demo that runs on:

- Desktop Standalone (Windows, macOS and Linux x86_64)
- iOS 9.0+
- Android 4.1+

Additionally, you will need a version of Unity that is 2017.4 or higher.

## AccessKey

Picovoice requires a valid Picovoice `AccessKey` at initialization. `AccessKey` acts as your credentials when using Picovoice SDKs.
You can get your `AccessKey` for free. Make sure to keep your `AccessKey` secret.
Signup or Login to [Picovoice Console](https://console.picovoice.ai/) to get your `AccessKey`.

## Usage

Replace your `AccessKey` in [`PicovoiceDemo.cs`](PicovoiceDemo.cs):

```csharp
private const string ACCESS_KEY = "${YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE}"; // AccessKey obtained from Picovoice Console (https://console.picovoice.ai/)
```

The easiest way to run the demo is to simply import the latest [Picovoice Unity package](../../sdk/unity) into your project, open the PicovoiceDemo scene and hit play. To run on other platforms or in the player, go to _File > Build Settings_, choose your platform and hit the `Build and Run` button.

Once the demo launches, you can say "Picovoice" and then give it any command within the smart lighting context:
